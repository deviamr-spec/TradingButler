bjective: Identify and resolve issues causing the trading bot to malfunction in live trading scenarios.

1. Connection Failures to MetaTrader 5
Issue: Unable to establish a connection to the MT5 terminal or account.

Potential Causes:

MT5 terminal isn't running or incorrectly configured.
Missing required permissions in the MT5 settings.
Suggested Fix:

def connect_to_mt5(self) -> bool:
    try:
        self.log_message("üîå Connecting to MetaTrader 5...", "INFO")
        if not mt5.initialize():
            error_code, error_desc = mt5.last_error()
            self.log_message(f"MT5 init failed: {error_code} - {error_desc}", "WARNING")
            return False
        self.log_message("‚úì MT5 initialized successfully", "INFO")
    except Exception as e:
        self.log_message(f"MT5 init exception: {str(e)}", "WARNING")
        return False
    return True
Ensure that MT5 is running and logged in correctly.
2. Auto Execution of Trades Not Working
Issue: Orders are not being executed as per the defined signals.

Potential Causes:

Inadequate error handling during order placements.
Incorrectly set risk parameters or trade limits.
Suggested Fix:

def execute_order(side, volume):
    order_type = mt5.ORDER_BUY if side == 'buy' else mt5.ORDER_SELL
    request = {
        "action": mt5.TRADE_ACTION_DEAL,
        "symbol": "XAUUSD",
        "volume": volume,
        "type": order_type,
        "deviation": 10,
        "magic": 123456,
        "comment": "Auto-trade",
        "type_time": mt5.ORDER_TIME_GTC,
        "type_filling": mt5.ORDER_FILLING_FOK,
    }
    result = mt5.order_send(request)
    if result.retcode != mt5.TRADE_RETCODE_DONE:
        print(f"‚ùå Order failed: {mt5.last_error()}")
Validate the response of the order_send to confirm successful order execution.
3. GUI Interaction Issues
Issue: GUI buttons or widgets are unresponsive.

Potential Causes:

GUI components being accessed before full initialization.
Event handling issues due to threading problems.
Suggested Fix:

if self.start_trading_button is not None:
    self.start_trading_button.clicked.connect(self.start_trading)
else:
    self.log_message("‚ùå Start Trading Button is not initialized", "ERROR")
Always ensure components like buttons are fully initialized before binding event handlers.
4. Insufficient Market Data for Auto Analysis
Issue: The trading bot fails to perform market analysis.

Potential Causes:

Not enough historical data retrieved from MT5.
Market connection issues or incorrect symbol selection.
Suggested Fix:

def check_market_data(self):
    if not mt5.symbol_select("XAUUSD", True):
        raise Exception("Symbol XAUUSD not available")
    # Fetch market data with sufficient checks.
Ensure that the selected symbol is available in the Market Watch within MT5.
5. Logging and Diagnostics
Issue: Inadequate logging makes troubleshooting difficult.

Suggested Fix:
Enhance the logging system to include more detailed outputs regarding the connection and order execution processes.

def log_event(event_description):
    with open("event_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
        log_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        log_file.write(f"{log_time} - {event_description}\n")
Log detailed information for each critical operation to assist in diagnosing issues.
